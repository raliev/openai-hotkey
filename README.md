Important:

While setting up or initially launching the app (openai-hotkey), you'll be asked to activate Accessibility features. This step is necessary to allow the app to capture the Cmd-Option-XXX shortcut keys when it's not the active window. You can check and verify if the permissions are properly set or change them at any time: Click the Apple icon in your OS menu bar and open System Settings. Choose Privacy & Security > Accessibility. Find openai-hotkey. 

Known issues:

* To halt the text-to-speech feature initiated by pressing Cmd-Option-S, you can click a stop button within the popup. But a glitch currently prevents this function from working properly without rebooting the application.
